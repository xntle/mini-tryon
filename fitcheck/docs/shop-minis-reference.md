# Analytics

Access aggregated data about your Mini.

---

## Overview

The Shop Minis CLI provides access to analytics reports that help you understand how your Mini is performing. These reports provide valuable insights into user engagement, conversions, and other key metrics.

The CLI provides several commands to work with analytics reports:

- Use the [`reports list`](./commands/reports-list) command to view all available report types
- Use the [`reports dates`](./commands/reports-dates) command to see available dates for a specific report
- Use the [`reports get`](./commands/reports-get) command to download report data as CSV

[Command - List all available reports](./commands/reports-list)

[Command - View available dates for a report](./commands/reports-dates)

[Command - Get report data as CSV](./commands/reports-get)

---

## Report types

The following report types are available for analytics:

### CONTENT_​IMPRESSIONS

Shows how often content associated with your Mini is viewed by users. These are generated by the `ContentWrapper` component.

**Fields:**

- `day`: The date for which data was collected (in UTC)
- `num_users`: Number of distinct users who viewed the content
- `num_views`: Total number of content views
- `impression_type`: Type of impression. This represents where the content was seen e.g. `IN_MINI`
- `content_public_id`: Identifier for the content
- `page_value`: Page where the content was viewed

### PRODUCT_​IMPRESSIONS

**Fields:**

- `day`: The date for which data was collected (in UTC)
- `product_id`: Identifier for the product
- `shop_id`: Identifier for the shop
- `impression_type`: Type of impression. This represents where the product was seen e.g. `IN_MINI`
- `num_users`: Number of unique users who viewed the product
- `num_impressions`: Total number of product impressions

### SALES

Shows sales data for your Mini, including order count and revenue.

**Fields:**

- `day`: The date for which data was collected (in UTC)
- `shop_id`: Identifier for the shop
- `product_id`: Identifier for the product
- `num_orders`: Number of orders
- `total_gmv_usd`: Total gross merchandise value in USD

### USAGE_​STATS

Shows how users interact with your Mini, over the course of a day.

**Fields:**

- `day`: The date for which data was collected (in UTC)
- `num_sessions`: Number of user sessions
- `num_users`: Number of unique users

# Coding Assistant Support

Learn how Shop Minis provide context to coding assistants for better development experience.

---

## Overview

Shop Mini projects include two context files that coding assistants automatically discover:

- **AGENTS.md** - The main context file containing Shop Mini development patterns, SDK guidelines, and best practices
- **CLAUDE.md** - A reference file for compatibility with specific tools

These files are included in every new project created with `npx shop-minis create` and provide coding assistants with the context they need to understand Shop Mini development.

---

## What It Provides

The context files provide coding assistants with key Shop Mini topics:

- **Development workflow** - Setup commands, device testing, debugging techniques
- **SDK-first component selection** - When to use Shop Minis React components vs custom solutions
- **Mobile-only design requirements** - Touch targets, WebView constraints, performance limits
- **Navigation and storage patterns** - Shop app navigation, SDK storage hooks instead of Web APIs
- **Project structure** - Required files, TypeScript patterns, Tailwind CSS configuration
- **Security and submission** - Trusted domains, publishing requirements, common pitfalls to avoid

---

## Customization

You can customize the AGENTS.md file to include:

- Your Shop Mini's specific features and functionality
- Team coding conventions
- Project-specific patterns
- Custom components and hooks you've built

Simply edit the AGENTS.md file in your project root. Coding assistants will use your additions when generating suggestions.

# Custom backend

You can use a custom backend to handle requests from your Mini. This page describes how to connect to your backend and verify requests.

---

## Verifying requests

You can verify a request originates from a user in the Shop app by attaching a temporary token to the request inside the Mini and exchanging it for a user identifier on your backend.

1. Generate a temporary token using the [`useGenerateUserToken`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/hooks/usegenerateusertoken) hook.
2. Attach the token in the headers of your [`network request`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/network-requests).
3. Verify the token using the [`userTokenVerify`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/minis-admin-api/mutations/usertokenverify) mutation in the Shop Minis Admin API.

This is useful for identifying the user making the request and for rate limiting requests to your backend.

Setup your Mini

You must run the [`setup`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/commands/setup) command and include the `openid` scope in your [`manifest.json`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/manifest-file) before you can use the [`useGenerateUserToken`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/hooks/usegenerateusertoken) hook.

Caching lookups

Ensure you cache the token exchange lookup to avoid unnecessary requests to the Shop Minis Admin API. You can use the `tokenExpiresAt` field in the response to invalidate the cache when the token expires.

## Example

This [`reference implementation`](https://github.com/Shopify/shop-minis/blob/main/supabase/README.md) shows how to securely authenticate Shop Mini users and process their requests using Supabase Edge Functions. This guide can be extrapolated to other backend services.

# Deeplinks

Learn how to implement and test deeplinks in your Shop Mini. This guide covers deeplink structure, testing during development, and best practices for handling different entry points into your Mini.

---

## Overview

Deeplinks enable users to navigate directly to specific content within your Shop Mini. They provide seamless entry points from external sources like push notifications, marketing campaigns, or other apps directly into specific screens or features of your Mini.

Key benefits:

- **Direct navigation**: Users can jump straight to relevant content
- **Enhanced user experience**: Reduces friction by eliminating navigation steps
- **Cross-app integration**: Allow other apps and services to link directly to your Mini's content

---

## Testing Deeplinks During Development

During development, you can test how your Mini handles different deeplink paths to ensure proper navigation and parameter handling. The Shop Minis dev server provides two convenient methods for testing deeplinks.

### Why Test Deeplinks?

Testing deeplinks during development helps you:

- Verify that navigation to specific screens works correctly
- Test entry points with query parameters
- Debug routing logic and path handling
- Ensure a smooth user experience when users arrive from external sources
- Validate that your Mini properly handles various path formats

### Method 1: Terminal Shortcut (Press `d`)

The quickest way to test deeplinks is directly from the development terminal:

1. Start your development server with `npm start`
2. Press `d` in the terminal
3. Enter your desired path when prompted (e.g., `/recipe/123` or `/search?q=pasta`)
4. Select your target platform (iOS Simulator or Android Device/Emulator)
5. Your Mini will automatically launch with the specified deeplink path

![Terminal showing deeplink option and path prompt](https://shopify.dev/assets/assets/images/api/shop-minis/deeplink-cli-DxPYbADb.png)

### Method 2: QR Code with Initial Path

For testing on physical iOS devices:

1. Start your development server with `npm start`
2. Press `q` to open the QR code page in your browser
3. Enter your desired path in the **"Initial Path"** field
4. Scan the QR code with your iOS device
5. Your Mini will open directly to the specified path

![QR code page showing the Initial Path input field](https://shopify.dev/assets/assets/images/api/shop-minis/deeplink-qr-BU_YEELP.png)

---

## Path Format

Paths should follow standard URL path conventions. The development server automatically handles path normalization, so both formats with and without leading slashes work correctly.

### Basic Path Formats

- **Simple navigation**: `/about`, `/settings`, `/products`
- **Resource with ID**: `/product/123`, `/user/profile/456`
- **Query parameters**: `/search?q=shoes&category=mens`
- **Complex paths**: `/category/electronics/phones?brand=apple&sort=price`
- **Root path**: `/` (navigates to your Mini's home screen)

### Path Normalization

Leading slashes are handled automatically by the development server:

- `/products` → normalized to `products`
- `products` → remains `products`
- `/` → special case, preserved as root

This ensures consistent behavior regardless of how developers enter paths during testing.

Running the [`install --check`](./commands/install) command will validate that your Mini only uses approved dependencies. You can use [`install --fix`](./commands/install) to fix any issues automatically.

Unapproved dependencies will cause automatic rejection

Your Mini will be automatically rejected if it includes any dependencies not listed above. This includes private npm packages (which are never allowed), dependencies vendored into your source code, and any modifications to approved dependencies. Only use the exact versions of approved dependencies listed on this page.

[Command - Learn more about the install command](./commands/install)

---

## Requesting optional dependencies

If you need a dependency that's not on the list, request it as early as possible. **The approval process takes days to weeks**, and there is no guarantee of approval. We can only approve Minis that use allowed dependencies.

To request a new dependency, file an issue in the [Shop Minis GitHub repository](https://github.com/Shopify/shop-minis/issues/new?template=dependency-request.yml).

Caution

Shop Minis should be built specifically for the Shop platform, not ported from existing applications.

### Why a dependency request might be rejected

Dependency requests could be rejected for:

- **Excessive dependencies**: Requesting many dependencies (10+)
- **Private packages**: Private npm packages are never allowed
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Dependencies with known security issues or poor security track records
- **Large bundle size**: Dependencies that significantly increase the Mini's size without sufficient benefit
- **Maintenance concerns**: Unmaintained or deprecated packages with no active development
- **Functionality overlap**: Dependencies that duplicate functionality already available in approved packages or the Shop Minis SDK
- **Paid dependencies**: Dependencies that require paid subscriptions or are closely tied to paid third-party platforms. We strongly prefer widely-adopted open source alternatives

Tip

Before requesting a dependency, check the [closed issues](https://github.com/Shopify/shop-minis/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+label%3Adependency-request) to see if it has been previously rejected and consider whether an approved alternative exists.

# Design

Minis should be designed and built with the following guiding principles in mind.

---

## UX Principles

### Unambiguous purpose

Each Mini should possess a singular, well-defined objective. The user interface should reinforce this purpose with a single primary action per screen.

### Rapid initialization and clear progress indication

Minis should offer quick initialization paths (e.g. pre-filled content from collections). Progress indicators should be implemented for multi-step processes (e.g. avatar creation flows).

### Engaging functionality

Minis should be both utilitarian and engaging, encouraging user interaction through delightful design elements rather than solely focusing on basic functionality. Gamification techniques, social engagement loops, and visual feedback should be intuitive and non-intrusive.

### Personalization and shareability

User engagement should be fostered through personalization features, such as avatars, saved looks, and personalized analysis. Clear sharing functionalities should be provided to generate user-generated content (UGC) and links back to the Mini or Shop.

### Efficient completion and habit formation

Each Mini should be designed to encourage repeat usage through clear options for saving, revisiting, or continuing progress.

### Accessibility by design

Adherence to established mobile app design guidelines and accessibility best practices is essential, including the implementation of large tap targets, appropriate contrast ratios, and alt text for images. Keyboard navigation and screen reader support should be ensured where applicable.

### Standardized interaction patterns

Existing Shop Minis SDK components and common interaction patterns should be utilized whenever feasible. Established navigation conventions, including modals, bottom sheets, and swipe gestures, should be adhered to in order to minimize user friction.

### Preserve integrity

The established character and flow of the user experience, once recognized through approval, should be maintained. Any dynamic modifications post-approval that could notably redefine the user's learned interactions or the Mini's core behavior should be approached with careful consideration for user continuity and confidence.

---

## Design specifications

### Safe area

Minis should observe the designated safe areas and avoid placing internal navigation buttons or any other pertinent information that is vital to the Mini's necessary function, outside the safe area bounds.

---

## Icons

The Shop Minis SDK uses [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) as its icon library. Lucide provides a comprehensive set of high-quality, open-source icons that are designed to be consistent, customizable, and accessible.

### Why Lucide?

- **Consistent Design**: All icons follow the same design principles and visual style
- **Customizable**: Easy to size, color, and style to match your design

### Prefer Icons Over Emojis

When building Shop Minis, **always prefer icons over emojis** for UI elements because icons render consistently across all platforms and devices.

### Get started

```bash
npx shop-minis install lucide-react
```

## Icon Usage

```tsx
import { Heart, AmpersandIcon, Pizza } from "lucide-react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="flex m-2 gap-2 justify-center">
      <Pizza />
      <AmpersandIcon />
      <Heart />
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Guidelines

Guidelines and requirements for building and submitting Shop Minis. These guidelines ensure a safe, reliable experience for buyers, merchants, and partners.

---

## Introduction

We're excited you're here and want to help you build the next big commerce experience using the Shop Minis SDK. Our team is readily available to answer questions, provide feedback, and help you succeed building your Mini through the [Shop Minis forum](https://community.shopify.dev/c/shop-minis/33). Our goal for buyers, merchants, and partners is to ensure a safe, reliable experience while using Minis, so we've detailed a set of guidelines we enforce during the submission and review process.

The following requirements are used to review all Shop Minis submitted for approval to be distributed through the Shop app. They are intended to provide the best experience across the entire Shop Mini lifecycle, from branding to installation, onboarding, functionality, and quality. By following these guidelines, you can ensure that the review process is as quick as possible when you submit your own Shop Mini.

These requirements are subject to change. Your Shop Mini will be expected to meet any new requirements that are added here with reasonable notice. Shopify can withhold its approval, reject, or remove a Shop Mini from the Shop app at its sole discretion.

---

## General guidelines

- Shop Minis must be built using our developer platform, the Shop Minis SDK, and other Shop Mini-specific functionality that is made available to developers from time to time.
- The Shop Minis SDK cannot be used to build anything other than a Shop Mini.
- Shopify periodically deprecates and removes functionality from the Shop Minis platform. Your Shop Mini may only use supported functionality. If your Shop Mini relies on deprecated functionality, we will notify you to submit a new version within a reasonable timeframe.
- Shop Minis must only fetch merchant/product data using the SDK.
- If you integrate with a third-party service, you must comply with their terms of use and ensure that they also comply with the Shop Minis Terms, particularly concerning Shop Merchant or Shop User data. You are responsible for making sure everything in your Shop Mini complies with the Shop Minis Terms and these guidelines, so please review and choose them carefully.
- Shopify reserves the right to enable Merchants to restrict or revoke Shop Mini developers' access to their Merchant Materials.
- Shop Minis may only make network calls to approved hosts within the viewer.
- A Mini must function solely within the Shop app; it cannot be a standalone app that operates outside of the Shop.
- Shop Minis that include user-generated images must use the [useCreateImageContent](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/hooks/content/usecreateimagecontent) hook to ensure images are moderated.
- Shop Minis including video, audio, or public commenting, must share detailed, established moderation practices as part of your submission description and will face additional review scrutiny. Developers should ensure the content follows the [Shop Content Policy](https://shop.app/content-policies).

---

## Prohibited practices and functionality

### Practices

- Minis must not violate the [Shop Minis Terms](https://shop.app/minis/terms), the [Partner Program Agreement](https://www.shopify.com/partners/terms), the [Shopify API License and Terms of Use](https://www.shopify.com/legal/api-terms), or our [Shop Content Policy](https://shop.app/content-policies).
- Minis must not use the words 'Shop' or 'Mini' in their name.
- Minis cannot violate any terms, conditions, or guidelines imposed by relevant third-party platforms (such as Apple App Store Guidelines or Google Play Store Policies) that are applicable to applications distributed or operating within their ecosystems, particularly concerning prohibited content, payments, or user safety.
- Minis cannot introduce any malicious software to the Shopify API or the Service (including the Shop app).
- Shop Minis must not link externally from within the viewer. Prohibited link outs include (but are not limited to) links to websites, other applications, or any stores.
- Minis cannot use dark UX patterns or include any other malicious activities toward users.

### Functionality

- Shop Minis may not allow users to communicate with each other through direct messaging, or other 1:1 means of communication.
- Shop Minis cannot run advertisements.
- Shop Minis cannot livestream user generated content.
- All user generated images must use the [useCreateImageContent](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/hooks/content/usecreateimagecontent) hook.

---

## Checkout & fees

- Developers cannot charge users fees for their use of their Shop Mini.
- Shop Minis may only use the Minis SDK to navigate to the shopping cart and checkout. Any payment processing (e.g., refunds) must go through Shop Pay.
- Shop Minis must not sell anything other than items made available in Shop's product catalog.

---

## Performance

- Shop Minis should be performant for buyers on the Shop app; please ensure yours has undergone any relevant testing and monitoring to avoid any lag that might be noticeable.
- We require that the loading time of your Shop Mini, from when the user taps on the entry point until the user can start interacting with the content in your Shop Mini viewer, should be no longer than 3 seconds as measured on a 5G connection.
- Minis must not exceed 5 MB in size.

---

## Data privacy

- You should exercise care when handling Shop User Data to ensure you've complied with privacy best practices, applicable laws, and the Shop Minis Terms.
- Shop Minis must include the URL of their privacy policy in the manifest. The privacy policy must clearly and explicitly state what data is collected and how it is used, explain the purposes for which the data is being processed, and how users may request deletion of that data. Your privacy policy must comply with the Shop Minis Terms, applicable laws, and these guidelines.
- Shop Minis should only request access to data relevant to the core functionality of the app and should only collect and use data required to accomplish the relevant task.
- Shop Minis must respect the user's permission settings and not attempt to manipulate, trick, or force people to consent to unnecessary data access.
- Developers can't access any Shop user data outside of what we make available (i.e., approved data fields we will share via the SDK) and what may specifically be permissible to request directly from a user (i.e., access to camera/photos).
- Developers cannot ask users for any other data directly (e.g., email addresses; payment card data; shipping or billing addresses; sensitive or health-related data of a Shop User).

You must not use Shop User Data for:

- Tracking user behavior across different contexts
- Creating targeted advertising
- Monetizing data through third parties
- User profiling beyond your Mini's authorized functionality or
- Selling or licensing user data to others.

---

## Merchant materials

- Only use Merchant Materials for the purpose of the Shop Mini.
- Shop Minis cannot manipulate merchant or product information, such as product names or prices. Minis cannot manipulate other screens on Shop.
- Developers can't use Merchant Materials (i.e., product listings, logos, images) for anything other than their Shop Mini. They can't export, share, or use this data outside of the Mini. See 4b in the Terms of Service for further details.
- Minis must not display merchants' products in a negative light.

---

## Violations and enforcement

- **Immediate rejection** - Security violations, privacy violations, legal non-compliance, prohibited functionality, performance issues, or missing documentation. Fix issues and resubmit.
- **Permanent removal** - Shopify reserves the right to permanently remove any Mini at its sole discretion for repeated violations or severe misconduct.
- **No appeals** - All decisions are final as required by law.

---

## Updating your mini

Every time you update your Mini, the Shopify team will review your code and approve or reject any changes based on the guidelines above.

title: useCreateImageContent
description: >-
The `useCreateImageContent` hook combines image upload with content creation
to generate user-generated content entries. Built on top of `useImageUpload`,
it extends the basic upload functionality with content management features
including titles, visibility controls, and unique IDs for sharing and
discovery.

### Visibility Options

The `visibility` parameter accepts an optional array of `ContentVisibility`
values:

- **`DISCOVERABLE`**: Makes content eligible for Shop's recommendation and
  discovery systems. Your content can appear in feeds and recommendations across
  the Shop app.

- **`LINKABLE`**: Enables shareable URLs for the content. Required if you want
  users to share content via direct links (generates a `shareableUrl`).

- **Both values**: `['DISCOVERABLE', 'LINKABLE']` - Maximum reach with content
  both discoverable in recommendations and shareable via links.

- **No values** (`null` or `[]`): Content remains private within your Mini,
  not discoverable or shareable externally.

### Use Cases

Choose visibility settings based on your content strategy:

- User reviews with photos: Use both `DISCOVERABLE` and `LINKABLE` for maximum
  reach

- Private user collections: Omit visibility or use empty array

- Shareable but not public: Use `LINKABLE` only

- Featured content: Use `DISCOVERABLE` to appear in recommendations

The hook handles both the image upload pipeline and content entity creation in
a single operation, automatically associating content with your Mini and
integrating with Shop's content systems.

> Caution: You must run the [`setup`](/docs/api/shop-minis/commands/setup) CLI
> command before using this hook so the content can be associated with the Mini.

# use​Error​Toast

The `useErrorToast` hook displays a non-blocking error notification. Use this for recoverable errors, warnings, or informational messages that don't prevent users from continuing their workflow. The toast appears temporarily at the top or bottom of the screen, auto-dismisses, and allows users to keep interacting with the Mini.

Note

Use `useErrorToast` for recoverable errors or warnings (e.g., failed to save preference, item out of stock, temporary network issues, validation errors). This shows a non-blocking notification that auto-dismisses and doesn't interrupt the user's current task. Use `useErrorScreen` for critical failures that block the user workflow (e.g., authentication failures, data corruption, network timeouts that prevent the app from functioning). This provides a full-screen error UI that the user must acknowledge before continuing.

# Manifest

Learn how to configure your Shop Mini using the manifest.json file. The manifest defines critical properties like description, permissions, scopes, and trusted domains.

---

## Overview

Every Shop Mini requires a `manifest.json` file in the src folder of the project. This file defines the configuration and capabilities of your Mini, including what permissions it needs, what user data it can access, and which external domains it can communicate with.

The manifest is validated during the submission process and must be properly configured for your Mini to function correctly.

---

## Manifest Structure

Here's an example of a complete `manifest.json` file:

## manifest.json

```json
{
  "name": "My Mini",
  "description": "A brief description of your mini that explains its purpose and functionality",
  "handle": "my-mini-handle",
  "permissions": ["CAMERA", "MICROPHONE", "MOTION"],
  "scopes": ["profile", "orders"],
  "trusted_domains": [
    "api.example.com/v1",
    "storage.googleapis.com/my-mini-bucket",
    "cdn.example.com/assets"
  ]
}
```

---

## Permissions

The `permissions` field is an array that specifies which native device capabilities your Mini requires. These permissions are requested from the user when your Mini attempts to use them.

### Available Permissions

- **`CAMERA`** - Access to the device camera for taking photos or videos
- **`MICROPHONE`** - Access to the device microphone for audio recording
- **`MOTION`** - Access to device motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope)

### Example

```json
{
  "permissions": ["CAMERA", "MICROPHONE"]
}
```

Caution

Only request permissions that are essential to your Mini's core functionality. Requesting unnecessary permissions may delay approval during the review process.

---

## Scopes

The `scopes` field is an array that defines what user data your Mini can access through the Shop Minis SDK. Some hooks in the SDK require specific scopes to be declared in the manifest before they can be used.

### Available Scopes

#### User Scopes

- **`openid`** - OpenID Connect authentication. Required for generating user tokens.
- **`profile`** - Read access to user's buyer profile.
- **`user_settings:read`** - Read access to the current user.

#### Product Scopes

- **`products:recent:read`** - Read access to the user's recently viewed products.
- **`products:recommendations:read`** - Read access to personalized product recommendations for the user.

#### Shop Scopes

- **`shops:recent:read`** - Read access to the user's recently viewed shops.
- **`shops:follows:read`** - Read access to shops the user follows.
- **`shops:follows:write`** - Write access to follow or unfollow shops.
- **`shops:recommendations:read`** - Read access to personalized shop recommendations for the user.

#### Order Scopes

- **`orders`** - Access to the user's order history and details.

#### Product List Scopes

- **`product_list:read`** - Read access to the user's collections (favorites, wishlists, etc.).
- **`product_list:write`** - Write access to create, update, or delete collections.
- **`product_list_item:write`** - Write access to add or remove items from collections.

### Example

```json
{
  "scopes": ["profile", "orders"]
}
```

Note

Always follow the principle of least privilege - only request scopes that are necessary for your Mini's functionality. Review the [Guidelines](./guidelines) for more information on data privacy requirements.

---

## Trusted Domains

The `trusted_domains` field is an array of domains that your Mini is allowed to communicate with. This is a critical security feature that restricts network requests to approved domains only.

### Usage

Trusted domains are required for:

- **Network requests** - Any `fetch()` calls to external APIs
- **Image sources** - Loading images from external URLs
- **Video sources** - Loading videos from external URLs
- **Other external resources** - Any content loaded from outside your Mini's bundle

### Domain Format

- Do not include the protocol (e.g., `https://`)
- You can include paths to be more specific
- Subdomains must be listed separately
- Do not include trailing slashes
- **Be as specific as possible** - For example, if using Google Cloud Storage, include the full path to your specific bucket rather than just the domain

### Example

```json
{
  "trusted_domains": [
    "api.example.com/v1",
    "storage.googleapis.com/my-mini-bucket",
    "cdn.example.com/assets"
  ]
}
```

Caution

Your Mini will not be able to make requests to any domain not listed in this array. Make sure to include all domains you need before submitting your Mini for review.

Tip

Be as specific as possible with your paths. Instead of `storage.googleapis.com`, use `storage.googleapis.com/my-mini-bucket` to limit access to only your bucket.

---

## Handle

The `handle` field is a unique identifier for your Mini. This value is automatically assigned when you create your Mini through the Shop Minis platform.

### Characteristics

- Automatically generated during Mini creation
- Must be unique across all Shop Minis
- Used internally by Shop to identify your Mini
- Cannot be changed after initial assignment
- Used to deeplink into your Mini (shop.app/mini/my-mini-handle)

### Example

```json
{
  "handle": "my-awesome-mini"
}
```

Note

You typically don't need to manually set this field. It's automatically populated when you initialize a new Mini project using the Shop Minis CLI.

---

## Description

The `description` field provides a brief summary of your Mini's purpose and functionality. This description is displayed to users in various places within the Shop app to help them understand what your Mini offers.

### Characteristics

- Should be concise and informative (recommended 30-50 characters)
- Helps users discover and understand your Mini's value proposition
- Used in search results and Mini details

### Example

```json
{
  "description": "Track your outfits every day"
}
```

### Best Practices

- **Be specific:** Clearly state what unique value your Mini provides
- **Keep it concise:** Aim for 30-50 characters maximum
- **Use action words:** Start with verbs like "Discover," "Shop," "Track," or "Explore"
- **Highlight key features:** Mention the main benefit or differentiator of your Mini

---

## Best Practices

### Minimize Permissions and Scopes

Only request the permissions and scopes that are absolutely necessary for your Mini's core functionality. This improves user trust and speeds up the review process.

### Keep Trusted Domains Updated

As your Mini evolves, make sure to update the `trusted_domains` list if you add new external services or APIs. Missing domains will cause runtime errors.

### Validation

Test your manifest configuration thoroughly during development to catch any issues before submission. The Shop Minis SDK will validate your manifest and provide warnings for common issues.

# Navigation transitions

Learn how to implement smooth navigation transitions in your Shop Mini. This guide covers MinisRouter setup, TransitionLink usage, and custom navigation patterns for creating fluid, app-like experiences.

---

## Overview

Shop Minis support smooth navigation transitions, providing native app-like page transitions. When enabled, navigations slide smoothly between pages with configurable animations.

Key features:

- **Automatic animations**: Forward navigation slides from right, back navigation slides from left
- **Gesture support**: Detects iOS swipe gestures and Android back button for appropriate animations

---

## Quick Start

To enable navigation transitions in your Shop Mini, wrap your app with MinisRouter and set the `viewTransitions` prop:

## Enable navigation transitions

## App.tsx

```tsx
import { MinisRouter } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";
import { Routes, Route } from "react-router";

function App() {
  return (
    <MinisRouter viewTransitions>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<HomePage />} />
        <Route path="/products/:id" element={<ProductPage />} />
      </Routes>
    </MinisRouter>
  );
}
```

---

## Navigation Components

Shop Minis provides two main ways to navigate with transitions:

### Transition​Link Component

Use TransitionLink for declarative navigation links:

[- TransitionLink API](./shop-minis/components/TransitionLink)

## Using TransitionLink

```tsx
import { TransitionLink } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

function ProductCard({ product }) {
  return (
    <div className="product-card">
      <TransitionLink to={`/products/${product.id}`}>
        <img src={product.image} alt={product.title} />
        <h3>{product.title}</h3>
      </TransitionLink>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## Programmatic Navigation

### use​Navigate​With​Transition Hook

For programmatic navigation with transitions, use the useNavigateWithTransition hook:

[- useNavigateWithTransition API](./shop-minis/hooks/useNavigateWithTransition)

## Using the navigation hook

```tsx
import { useNavigateWithTransition } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";
import { Button } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

function CheckoutButton() {
  const navigateWithTransition = useNavigateWithTransition();

  const handleClick = () => {
    // Perform validation or API calls
    // Navigate with smooth transition
    navigateWithTransition("/checkout");
  };

  return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Proceed to Checkout</Button>;
}
```

---

## Back Navigation

When navigating back (pop/back button), the old page slides right and fades out, and the previous page slides in from the left. This is automatically triggered by iOS swipe gesture or Android back button. You can programmatically navigate back by using the `useNavigateWithTransition` hook with a negative number.

## Back Navigation

```tsx
import { useNavigateWithTransition } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

const navigateWithTransition = useNavigateWithTransition();

// Go back one page
navigateWithTransition(-1);
```

---

## Best Practices

- **Use TransitionLink for static navigation**: TransitionLink is optimized for declarative navigation
- **Batch state updates**: Perform state updates before navigation to avoid mid-transition renders
- **Respect prefers-reduced-motion**: The default styles disable animations when users prefer reduced motion

### Accessibility

- Transitions automatically respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Ensure focus management across page transitions
- Provide clear visual feedback during navigation

---

## Navigation Guards

You can prevent navigation by using custom click handlers:

## Conditional navigation

```tsx
import { TransitionLink } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

function SecureLink() {
  var canNavigateThere = false;

  return (
    <TransitionLink
      to="/account"
      onClick={(e) => {
        if (!canNavigateThere) {
          e.preventDefault();
          // Show error modal instead
          console.error("You are not authorized to navigate there");
        }
      }}
    >
      Protected Page
    </TransitionLink>
  );
}
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Transitions Not Working

1. **Check viewTransitions prop**: Ensure MinisRouter has `viewTransitions` enabled
2. **Navigating backwards**: Check if you are using the `useNavigateWithTransition(-1)` hook to navigate backwards
3. **Absolute URLs**: TransitionLink warns about absolute URLs - use relative paths

### Animation Issues

- **Jumpy transitions**: Ensure consistent layouts between pages
- **Missing animations**: Check CSS isn't overriding transition styles
- **Performance**: Large DOM changes during transition can cause stuttering

# Network requests

Shop Minis can only make network requests to approved domains. This page describes how to add trusted domains and how to perform fetch requests inside your Mini.

---

## Trusted domains

To allow your Mini to make network requests to external domains, you need to add them to the `trusted_domains` array in your `manifest.json` file. This will be reviewed when your Mini is submitted.

## Adding trusted domains to manifest.json

```json
{
  "name": "My Mini",
  "trusted_domains": ["example.com", "api.example.com"]
}
```

---

## Making requests

Once you have added trusted domains to your manifest, you can use standard fetch requests in your Mini to communicate with your backend services. See [Custom backend](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shop-minis/custom-backend) for more information on how to verify requests.

Make sure to handle errors appropriately and provide feedback to users when requests fail.

Authenticating requests

Do not include secret tokens or API keys in your Mini code. If you need to make authenticated API requests, you should wrap or proxy the request on your own backend using the verification process for rate limiting.

---

## Handling CORS

Any backend services that your Shop Mini communicates with must be configured to allow [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/CORS) requests from `localhost:*` (all localhost ports).

This applies to both development and production environments, as Shop Minis use this origin to make requests. Ensure your server includes appropriate CORS headers to allow requests from these origins.

# Publishing

Publishing your Shop Mini to the Shop app includes a manual review process. You can use the [`submit`](./commands/submit) command to create a submission, which will upload your source code and initiate a review. Once your submission has been approved, your Shop Mini will be made available to users in the Shop app.

---

## Requirements

- You have a [Shopify Partners account](https://www.shopify.com/partners).
- You have set up your Mini using the [`setup`](./commands/setup) command.

[Command - Learn more about the setup command](./commands/setup)

---

## Submitting your Mini

Use the [`submit`](./commands/submit) command to submit your code for review.

You'll need to enter a description to tell us what your Shop Mini does and any changes since your last submission. Please provide a video showing an end-to-end flow of your Shop Mini. This will help provide our team with more clarity during the review process.

Your source code will be uploaded for us to review. Once we've reviewed your submission, we'll either approve it or ask you to make some changes.

If it's approved, your Mini will be made available to users in the Shop app when the Shop Team decides to release it.

If it's rejected, we'll provide detailed actionable feedback to assist with your next submission. If you have questions or concerns about the outcome of a review, please visit the [Shop Minis forum](https://community.shopify.dev/c/shop-minis/33) in the Shopify Community.

Submission requirements

Submissions have a maximum size of 5MB and must include a `src/icon.png` file, which should be 1024x1024px and less than 512KB.

## Submit your Mini

```bash
npx shop-minis submit [options]
```

---

## Keeping your Mini up to date

Your Mini must use a compatible SDK version to work with the Shop app. You should upgrade your Mini to the latest SDK version:

- **Before making a new submission** - Submissions with outdated SDK versions will be rejected
- **When requested by Shop Minis team** - If we ask you to upgrade due to compatibility issues

Use the [`upgrade`](./commands/upgrade) command to update your Mini to the latest SDK version:

[Command - Learn more about the upgrade command](./commands/upgrade)

## Upgrade your Mini

```bash
npx shop-minis upgrade [options]
```

---

## Checking the status of a submission

Use the [`check-submission`](./commands/check-submission) command to see details about your latest submission.

## Check the status of a submission

```bash
npx shop-minis check-submission [options]
```

---

## Cancelling a submission

If you realize there is an issue with the code you have submitted or you change your mind, you can cancel a submission with the [`cancel-submission`](./commands/cancel-submission) command.

This will only work for pending submissions—if we have already reviewed the submission, you'll need to make a new one. If we have approved a submission that you later realize includes a bug, please contact us through the [Shop Minis forum](https://community.shopify.dev/c/shop-minis/33).

## Cancel a submission

```bash
npx shop-minis cancel-submission [options]
```

---

## Updating a submission

It's not possible to update a pending submission. If you'd like to make changes, you'll need to cancel the pending submission and make a new one.

There can only be one pending submission at a time, you cannot line up multiple submissions. You should either cancel and combine the changes into a single submission or wait for the pending submission to be reviewed first.

# Storing data

The Minis platform provides a few different ways to store data associated with a user. This guide will walk you through the different options and when to use each.

---

## Async storage

The `useAsyncStorage` hook provides a way to store data in the device's local storage. It's a simple and easy way to store data that persists across sessions, but it will be deleted if the user uninstalls the Shop app.

[Hook - Learn more about the useAsyncStorage hook](./hooks/storage/useAsyncStorage)

## Using async storage

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

import { useAsyncStorage } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { getItem, setItem, removeItem, getAllKeys, clear } = useAsyncStorage();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function handleStorageOperations() {
      // Get an item from storage
      const value = await getItem({ key: "myKey" });
      console.log({ value });

      // Set an item in storage
      await setItem({ key: "myKey", value: "Hello, World!" });

      // Remove an item from storage
      await removeItem({ key: "myKey" });

      // Get all keys in storage
      const keys = await getAllKeys();
      console.log({ keys });

      // Clear all items from storage
      await clear();
    }

    handleStorageOperations();
  }, [getItem, removeItem, setItem, getAllKeys, clear]);
}
```

---

## Secure storage

The `useSecureStorage` hook provides a way to store credentials and other sensitive data in the device's secure storage. It's a more secure way to store data that persists across sessions, but it will be deleted if the user uninstalls the Shop app.

[Hook - Learn more about the useSecureStorage hook](./hooks/storage/useSecureStorage)

## Using secure storage

```tsx
import { useEffect } from "react";

import { useSecureStorage } from "@shopify/shop-minis-react";

export default function MyComponent() {
  const { getSecret, setSecret, removeSecret } = useSecureStorage();

  useEffect(() => {
    async function handleSecureStorageOperations() {
      // Get a secret from secure storage
      const secret = await getSecret();
      console.log({ secret });

      // Set a secret in secure storage
      await setSecret({ value: "Sensitive Data" });

      // Remove a secret from secure storage
      await removeSecret();
    }

    handleSecureStorageOperations();
  }, [getSecret, setSecret, removeSecret]);
}
```

# Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions for Mini development.

---

## Connection issues

If you're having connection issues or your Mini isn't loading:

- For WiFi: Verify devices are on the same network segment
- Check firewall settings aren't blocking port 5173
- Try using your computer's IP directly: `npx shop-minis dev --host 192.168.1.100`

---

## Android Port Forwarding

In some cases your Android device might not be able to connect to the Mini's dev server. Port forwarding creates a tunnel between your Android device and development machine, allowing the Shop app to access your Mini.

---

## Setting Up

```bash
# Forward the Vite dev server port
adb reverse tcp:5173 tcp:5173
```

This maps port 5173 on the Android device to port 5173 on your development machine.
